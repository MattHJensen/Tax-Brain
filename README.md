# Tax-Brain

Tax-Brain is a Python package that wraps multiple economic models in one easy
to use interface.

## Disclaimer

Tax-brain is currently under development. Users should be aware that the model
components and API could change significantly. There is currently no guarantee
of accuracy and the code should not yet be used for publications or research
purposes. Until there is an initial stable release, continuous refactoring
should be expected.
