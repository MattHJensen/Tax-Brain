# Tax-Brain Road Map

## Near-Tear

The first goal of the Tax-Brain project is to wrap the [Tax-Calculator](https://www.pslmodels.org/Catalog/Tax-Calculator.html)
and [Behavioral-Responses](https://www.pslmodels.org/Catalog/Behavioral-Responses.html)
packages. We also want to provide an interface for COMP that will mimic the
current capabilities of [TaxBrain](https://www.ospc.org/taxbrain/).

## Long-Term

The next models to be incorporated into Tax-Brain will be (in no particular order):
* [B-Tax](https://www.pslmodels.org/Catalog/B-Tax.html)
* [OG-USA](https://www.pslmodels.org/Catalog/OG-USA.html)
* [Business-Taxation](https://github.com/PSLmodels/Business-Taxation)
